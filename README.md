# Platzi Badges

## A Conference Management System.

An application developed for the React Course at Platzi. At start we use React class components then I change this approach to use React Hooks and styled components for the makeup.

I am adding new features to the app to use the knowledge earn in the courses as Front-end developer at Platzi.

What I learned?

- React
