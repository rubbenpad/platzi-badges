# Platzi Badges

## Conference Management System

![App screenshot](./screenshots/platzibadges.png)

Application to register the attendants to PlatziConf created with the knowledge earned in the ReactJS course at Platzi.

In the course, the UI was styled with Bootstrap but I wanted to try styled-components and I like them. Also, we just create the frontend and there isn't data persistence, I wanted to make some extra work and create the backend with the knowledge earned in the Backend with Node Course at Platzi.

I also implemented Redux in the project to manage the state and to practice how to work with Redux.
